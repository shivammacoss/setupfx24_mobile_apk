## STEP 1: Build AAB for Google Play

**IMPORTANT: Google Play requires AAB format, NOT APK.**

Run this command to build the production AAB:
```bash
cd /path/to/setupfx_mobile_app
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

This uses the `production` profile from eas.json which:
- Builds AAB format (default for production)
- Uses `channel: "production"` for OTA updates
- Auto-increments version code

After the build completes, download the `.aab` file from the EAS dashboard.

## STEP 2: Host Policy Pages

Upload these HTML files to your server so they're publicly accessible:

1. **Privacy Policy** → `privacy-policy.html`
   - Host at: `https://setupfx24.com/privacy-policy`
   
2. **Terms of Service** → `terms-of-service.html`
   - Host at: `https://setupfx24.com/terms-of-service`

3. **Account Deletion Policy** → `account-deletion-policy.html`
   - Host at: `https://setupfx24.com/account-deletion`

### How to host on your server:
```bash
# Copy HTML files to frontend public directory
cp privacy-policy.html ~/setupfx24/frontend/public/privacy-policy.html
cp terms-of-service.html ~/setupfx24/frontend/public/terms-of-service.html
cp account-deletion-policy.html ~/setupfx24/frontend/public/account-deletion.html

## STEP 6: OTA Updates After Publishing

Your app is configured for OTA updates via Expo. After publishing to Play Store:

### Push an OTA update (no new AAB needed):
```bash
cd /path/to/setupfx_mobile_app
eas update --channel production --message "Bug fixes and improvements"
```

### When you need a new AAB (native code changes):
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```
Then upload the new AAB to Play Console.

### OTA vs Store Update:
| Change Type | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| JS/React code changes | OTA update (`eas update`) |
| New npm packages with native code | New AAB build |
| app.json config changes | New AAB build |
| Asset changes (images, fonts) | OTA update |
| SDK version upgrade | New AAB build |
